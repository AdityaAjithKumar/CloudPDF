Doctor John Dolittle, an animal-lover living in Puddleby-on-the-Marsh, loses his human patients due to his numerous pets.  His parrot, Polynesia, suggests he become an animal doctor, revealing that animals have their own languages.  Dolittle learns these languages and becomes a successful animal doctor, even prescribing spectacles for a plow-horse.  His fame spreads among animals worldwide. However, his growing menagerie and refusal to turn away animals in need leads to financial trouble again after his sister leaves.  The animals help with housework and sell goods, but winter brings hardship.  A swallow arrives with news of a deadly monkey sickness in Africa, prompting Dolittle to embark on a journey there with Polynesia, Chee-Chee the monkey, the crocodile, Jip the dog, Dab-Dab the duck, Gub-Gub the pig, and Too-Too the owl.  Aided by flying fish and porpoises, they near Africa, but a storm strikes, leaving their ship's fate uncertain.
