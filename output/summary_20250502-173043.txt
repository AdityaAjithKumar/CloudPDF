RescueRoute is a proposed AI-powered smart traffic system designed to expedite ambulance travel during emergencies.  It uses sound recognition (siren and honking analysis) to automatically detect approaching ambulances and dynamically adjusts traffic signals to create a clear path.  This system aims to reduce intersection accidents by controlling opposing traffic flow and improve emergency response times with minimal infrastructure changes.  By leveraging AI and IoT, RescueRoute establishes direct communication between ambulances and traffic signals, eliminating manual intervention and potentially saving lives.
