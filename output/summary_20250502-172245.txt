RescueRoute is a proposed AI-powered smart traffic system designed to expedite ambulance travel during emergencies.  It uses AI and IoT sensors to detect approaching ambulances via siren and honking analysis. Upon detection, the system dynamically changes traffic signals, granting the ambulance a green light while simultaneously halting cross-traffic to prevent accidents and minimize delays. This automated system requires minimal infrastructure changes and aims to significantly improve emergency response times and save lives in congested urban environments.
